# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge, I used Leaflet to plot a map of earthquake data gathered from the United States Geological Survey. I used HTML, JavaScript to create the map, loading in geographical content, creating markers, and editing tooltips to show details specific to the event.

I used knowledge from class lecture and course materials, and code gathered from the Xpert Learning Assistant to complete this challenge.
